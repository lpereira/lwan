<h1>It's a smolsite!</h1>

<p>This whole site fits inside the URL!</p>

<p>To host yours: use the command-line: put everything in a ZIP file, Base 64 encode it, and tack it after "https://smolsite.zip/":</p>

<pre>
$ zip -DXjq9 somesite.zip index.html mylogo.png
$ echo "https://smolsite.zip/`base64 --wrap 0 < somesite.zip`"
</pre>

<h1 style="margin-top: 300px">FAQ</h1>
<h2>I don't have a command line, can I still share a smolsite?</h2>
<p>Sure, drag the ZIP file to the bottom purple bar.</p>

<h2>Can I host a website on a piece of paper?</h2>
<p>Yes! Click on the QR code below to see a printable/scannable version
of this website.</p>

<h2>Is this open source?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lpereira/lwan">Yes, it is open source</a>.</p>

<h2>Is the ZIP file unpacked in the server?</h2> <p>The contents are
processed in the server and kept in RAM for 15 minutes.  The content is gone
after that, unless someone opens the same link again.</p>

<h2>Is this protected against ZIP bombs?</h2> <p>Deflated data is sent back
unmodified to browsers, and no recursive unzipping happens.  So, yes, it's
somewhat protected against ZIP bombs.</p>

<h2>Can content be taken down?</h2> <p>We'll do our best to ensure exact URLs
are blocked from being shared by smolsite. (We can't fully take the content
down, as it is in the URL and that's something we do not control: if someone
has a link to improper content, they can extract it without the need of
smolsite.)
Send the full link to <tt>abuse.smolsite&commat;tia.mat.br</tt>
with the reason the content should be taken down and we'll take it from there.</p>
