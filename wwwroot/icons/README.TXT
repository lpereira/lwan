Public Domain Icons
-------------------

These icons were originally made for Mosaic for X and have been included in
the NCSA httpd and Apache server distributions in the past.  They are in the
public domain and may be freely included in any application.  The originals
were done by Kevin Hughes (kevinh@kevcom.com).  Andy Polyakov tuned the icon
colors and added few new images.

If you'd like to contribute additions to this set, contact the httpd
documentation project http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/.

Almost all of these icons are 20x22 pixels in size. There are alternative
icons in the "small" directory that are 16x16 in size, provided by Mike
Brown (mike@hyperreal.org).
