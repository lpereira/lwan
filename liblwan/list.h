/*
 * list - double linked list routines
 * Author: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
 *
 * The list header contains routines for manipulating double linked lists.
 * It defines two types: struct list_head used for anchoring lists, and
 * struct list_node which is usually embedded in the structure which is placed
 * in the list.
