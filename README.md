Building
--------

Before installing Lwan, ensure all dependencies are installed. All of them
are common dependencies found in any GNU/Linux distribution; package names
will be different, but it shouldn't be difficult to search using whatever
package management tool that's used by your distribution.

### Required dependencies

 - [CMake](https://cmake.org/), at least version 2.8
 - [ZLib](http://zlib.net)

### Optional dependencies

The build system will look for these libraries and enable/link if available.

 - [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org) or [LuaJIT 2.0](http://luajit.org)
 - [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)
 - [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli)
 - Alternative memory allocators can be used by passing `-DUSE_ALTERNATIVE_MALLOC` to CMake with the following values:
    - ["mimalloc"](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc)
    - ["jemalloc"](http://jemalloc.net/)
    - ["tcmalloc"](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools)
    - "auto": Autodetect from the list above, falling back to libc malloc if none found
 - To run test suite:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) (2.6+) with Requests
    - [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org)
 - To run benchmark:
    - Special version of [Weighttp](https://github.com/lpereira/weighttp)
    - [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
 - To build TechEmpower benchmark suite:
    - Client libraries for either [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org)
    - [SQLite 3](http://sqlite.org)


### Common operating system package names

#### Minimum to build
 - ArchLinux: `pacman -S cmake zlib`
 - FreeBSD: `pkg install cmake pkgconf`
 - Ubuntu 14+: `apt-get update && apt-get install git cmake zlib1g-dev pkg-config`
 - macOS: `brew install cmake`

#### Build all examples
 - ArchLinux: `pacman -S cmake zlib sqlite luajit libmariadbclient gperftools valgrind`
 - FreeBSD: `pkg install cmake pkgconf sqlite3 lua51`
 - Ubuntu 14+: `apt-get update && apt-get install git cmake zlib1g-dev pkg-config lua5.1-dev libsqlite3-dev libmysqlclient-dev`
 - macOS: `brew install cmake mysql-connector-c sqlite lua@5.1 pkg-config`

### Build commands

#### Clone the repository

    ~$ git clone git://github.com/lpereira/lwan
    ~$ cd lwan

#### Create the build directory

    ~/lwan$ mkdir build
    ~/lwan$ cd build

#### Select build type

Selecting a *release* version (no debugging symbols, messages, enable some
optimizations, etc):

    ~/lwan/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

If you'd like to enable optimizations but still use a debugger, use this instead:

    ~/lwan/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

To disable optimizations and build a more debugging-friendly version:

    ~/lwan/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

#### Build Lwan

    ~/lwan/build$ make

This will generate a few binaries:

 - `src/bin/lwan/lwan`: The main Lwan executable. May be executed with `--help` for guidance.
 - `src/bin/testrunner/testrunner`: Contains code to execute the test suite.
 - `src/samples/freegeoip/freegeoip`: [FreeGeoIP sample implementation](https://freegeoip.lwan.ws). Requires SQLite.
 - `src/samples/techempower/techempower`: Code for the TechEmpower Web Framework benchmark. Requires SQLite and MySQL libraries.
 - `src/samples/clock/clock`: [Clock sample](https://time.lwan.ws). Generates a GIF file that always shows the local time.
 - `src/bin/tools/mimegen`: Builds the extension-MIME type table. Used during build process.
 - `src/bin/tools/bin2hex`: Generates a C file from a binary file, suitable for use with #include.
 - `src/bin/tools/configdump`: Dumps a configuration file using the configuration reader API.

#### Remarks

Passing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` will enable some compiler
optimizations (such as [LTO](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization))
and tune the code for current architecture. *Please use this version
when benchmarking*, as the default is the Debug build, which not only
logs all requests to the standard output, but does so while holding a
mutex.

The default build (i.e. not passing `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`) will build
a version suitable for debugging purposes.  This version can be used under
Valgrind *(if its headers are present)* and includes debugging messages that
are stripped in the release version.  Debugging messages are printed for
each and every request.

On debug builds, sanitizers can be enabled.  To select which one to build Lwan
with, specify one of the following options to the CMake invocation line:

 - `-DSANITIZER=ubsan` selects the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer.
 - `-DSANITIZER=address` selects the Address Sanitizer.
 - `-DSANITIZER=thread` selects the Thread Sanitizer.

Alternative memory allocators can be selected as well.  Lwan currently
supports [TCMalloc](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) and
[jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) out of the box.  To use either one of them,
pass `-DALTERNATIVE_MALLOC=ON` to the CMake invocation line.

### Tests

    ~/lwan/build$ make teststuite

This will compile the `testrunner` program and execute regression test suite
in `src/scripts/testsuite.py`.

### Benchmark

    ~/lwan/build$ make benchmark

This will compile `testrunner` and execute benchmark script
`src/scripts/benchmark.py`.

### Coverage

Lwan can also be built with the Coverage build type by specifying
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage`.  This enables the `generate-coverage` make
target, which will run `testrunner` to prepare a test coverage report with
[lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php).

Every commit in this repository triggers the generation of this report,
and results are [publicly available](https://buildbot.lwan.ws/lcov/).

Running
-------

Set up the server by editing the provided `lwan.conf`; the format is
explained in details below.

Configuration files are loaded from the current directory. If no changes
are made to this file, running Lwan will serve static files located in
the `./wwwroot` directory. Lwan will listen on port 8080 on all interfaces.

Lwan will detect the number of CPUs, will increase the maximum number of
open file descriptors and generally try its best to autodetect reasonable
settings for the environment it's running on.  Many of these settings can
be tweaked in the configuration file, but it's usually a good idea to not
mess with them.

Optionally, the `lwan` binary can be used for one-shot static file serving
without any configuration file. Run it with `--help` for help on that.

Configuration File
----------------

### Format

Lwan uses a familiar `key = value` configuration file syntax.  Comments are
supported with the `#` character (similar to e.g.  shell scripts, Python,
and Perl).  Nested sections can be created with curly brackets.  Sections
can be empty; in this case, curly brackets are optional.

`some_key_name` is equivalent to `some key name` in configuration files (as
an implementation detail, code reading configuration options will only be
given the version with underscores).

Values can contain environment variables. Use the syntax `${VARIABLE_NAME}`.
Default values can be specified with a colon (e.g.  `${VARIABLE_NAME:foo}`,
which evaluates to `${VARIABLE_NAME}` if it's set, or `foo` otherwise).

```
sound volume = 11 # This one is 1 louder

playlist metal {
   files = '''
	/multi/line/strings/are/supported.mp3
	/anything/inside/these/are/stored/verbatim.mp3
   '''
}

playlist chiptune {
   files = """
	/if/it/starts/with/single/quotes/it/ends/with/single/quotes.mod
	/but/it/can/use/double/quotes.s3m
   """
}
```

#### Value types

| Type   | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `str`  | Any kind of free-form text, usually application specific |
| `int`  | Integer number. Range is application specific |
| `time` | Time interval.  See table below for units |
| `bool` | Boolean value. See table below for valid values |

#### Time Intervals

Time fields can be specified using multipliers. Multiple can be specified, they're
just added together; for instance, "1M 1w" specifies "1 month and 1 week".  The following
table lists all known multipliers:

| Multiplier | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `s`        | Seconds |
| `m`        | Minutes |
| `h`        | Hours |
| `d`        | Days |
| `w`        | Weeks |
| `M`        | Months |
| `y`        | Years |

A number with a multiplier not in this table is ignored; a warning is issued while
reading the configuration file.  No spaces must exist between the number and its
multiplier.

#### Boolean Values

| True Values | False Values |
|-------------|--------------|
| Any integer number different than 0 | 0 |
| `on` | `off` |
| `true` | `false` |
| `yes` | `no` |

### Global Settings

It's generally a good idea to let Lwan decide the best settings for your
environment.  However, not every environment is the same, and not all uses
can be decided automatically, so some configuration options are provided.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `keep_alive_timeout` | `time`  | `15` | Timeout to keep a connection alive |
| `quiet` | `bool` | `false` | Set to true to not print any debugging messages. Only effective in release builds. |
| `reuse_port` | `bool` | `false` | Sets `SO_REUSEPORT` to `1` in the master socket |
| `expires` | `time` | `1M 1w` | Value of the "Expires" header. Default is 1 month and 1 week |
| `threads` | `int` | `0` | Number of I/O threads. Default (0) is the number of online CPUs |
| `proxy_protocol` | `bool` | `false` | Enables the [PROXY protocol](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/). Versions 1 and 2 are supported. Only enable this setting if using Lwan behind a proxy, and the proxy supports this protocol; otherwise, this allows anybody to spoof origin IP addresses |
| `max_post_data_size` | `int` | `40960` | Sets the maximum number of data size for POST requests, in bytes |

### Straitjacket

Lwan can drop its privileges to a user in the system, and limit its
filesystem view with a chroot.  While not bulletproof, this provides a
first layer of security in the case there's a bug in Lwan.

In order to use this feature, declare a `straitjacket` section, and set
some options.  This requires Lwan to be executed as `root`.

Although this section can be written anywhere in the file (as long as
it is a top level declaration), if any directories are open, due to
e.g.  instantiating the `serve_files` module, Lwan will refuse to
start.  (This check is only performed on Linux as a safeguard for
malconfiguration.)

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `user` | `str`  | `NULL` | Drop privileges to this user name |
| `chroot` | `str` | `NULL` | Path to `chroot()` |
| `drop_capabilities` | `bool` | `true` | Drop all capabilities with capset(2) (under Linux), or pledge(2) (under OpenBSD). |

### Listeners

In order to specify which interfaces Lwan should listen on, a `listener` section
must be specified.  Only one listener per Lwan process is accepted at the moment.
The only parameter to a listener block is the interface address and the port to
listen on; anything inside a listener section are instances of modules.

The syntax for the listener parameter is `${ADDRESS}:${PORT}`, where `${ADDRESS}`
can either be `*` (binding to all interfaces), an IPv6 address (if surrounded by
square brackets), an IPv4 address, or a hostname.  If systemd's socket activation
is used, `systemd` can be specified as a parameter.

### Routing URLs Using Modules or Handlers

In order to route URLs, Lwan matches the largest common prefix from the request
URI with a set of prefixes specified in the listener section.  How a request to
a particular prefix will be handled depends on which handler or module has been
declared in the listener section.  Handlers and modules are similar internally;
handlers are merely functions and hold no state, and modules holds state (named
instance).  Multiple instances of a module can appear in a listener section.

There is no special syntax to attach a prefix to a handler or module; all the
configuration parser rules apply here.  Use `${NAME} ${PREFIX}` to link the
`${PREFIX}` prefix path to either a handler named `${NAME}` (if `${NAME}`
begins with `&`, as with C's "address of" operator), or a module named
`${NAME}`.  Empty sections can be used here.

Each module will have its specific set of options, and they're listed in the
next sections.  In addition to configuration options, a special `authorization`
section can be present in the declaration of a module instance.  Handlers do
not take any configuration options, but may include the `authorization`
section.

A list of built-in modules can be obtained by executing Lwan with the `-m`
command-line argument.  The following is some basic documentation for the
modules shipped with Lwan.

#### File Serving

The `serve_files` module will serve static files, and automatically create
directory indices or serve pre-compressed files.  It'll generally try its
best to serve files in the fastest way possible according to some heuristics.


| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `path`                     | `str`  | `NULL`       | Path to a directory containing files to be served |
| `index_path`               | `str`  | `index.html` | File name to serve as an index for a directory |
| `serve_precompressed_path` | `bool` | `true`       | If $FILE.gz exists, is smaller and newer than $FILE, and the client accepts `gzip` encoding, transfer it |
| `auto_index`               | `bool` | `true`       | Generate a directory list automatically if no `index_path` file present.  Otherwise, yields 404 |
| `auto_index_readme`        | `bool` | `true`       | Includes the contents of README files as part of the automatically generated directory index |
| `directory_list_template`  | `str`  | `NULL`       | Path to a Mustache template for the directory list; by default, use an internal template |
| `read_ahead`               | `int`  | `131702`     | Maximum amount of bytes to read ahead when caching open files.  A value of `0` disables readahead.  Readahead is performed by a low priority thread to not block the I/O threads while file extents are being read from the filesystem. |

#### Lua

The `lua` module will allow requests to be serviced by scripts written in
the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) programming language.  Although the
functionality provided by this module is quite spartan, it's able to run
frameworks such as [Sailor](https://github.com/lpereira/sailor-hello-lwan).

Scripts can be served from files or embedded in the configuration file, and
the results of loading them, the standard Lua modules, and (optionally, if
using LuaJIT) optimizing the code will be cached for a while.  Each I/O
thread in Lwan will create an instance of a Lua VM (i.e.  one `lua_State`
struct for every I/O thread), and each Lwan coroutine will spawn a Lua
thread (with `lua_newthread()`) per request.  Because of this, Lua scripts
can't use global variables, as they may be not only serviced by different
threads, but the state will be available only for the amount of time
specified in the `cache_period` configuration option.

There's no need to have one instance of the Lua module for each endpoint; a
single script, embedded in the configuration file or otherwise, can service
many different endpoints.  Scripts are supposed to implement functions with
the following signature: `handle_${METHOD}_${ENDPOINT}(req)`, where
`${METHOD}` can be a HTTP method (i.e.  `get`, `post`, `head`, etc.), and
`${ENDPOINT}` is the desired endpoint to be handled by that function.  The
special `${ENDPOINT}` `root` can be specified to act as a catchall.  The
`req` parameter points to a metatable that contains methods to obtain
information from the request, or to set the response, as seen below:

   - `req:query_param(param)` returns the query parameter (from the query string) with the key `param`, or `nil` if not found
   - `req:post_param(param)` returns the post parameter (only for `${POST}` handlers) with the key `param`, or `nil` if not found
   - `req:set_response(str)` sets the response to the string `str`
   - `req:say(str)` sends a response chunk (using chunked encoding in HTTP)
   - `req:send_event(event, str)` sends an event (using server-sent events)
   - `req:cookie(param)` returns the cookie named `param`, or `nil` is not found
   - `req:set_headers(tbl)` sets the response headers from the table `tbl`; a header may be specified multiple times by using a table, rather than a string, in the table value (`{'foo'={'bar', 'baz'}}`); must be called before sending any response with `say()` or `send_event()`
   - `req:sleep(ms)` pauses the current handler for the specified amount of milliseconds
   - `req:ws_upgrade()` returns `1` if the connection could be upgraded to a WebSocket; `0` otherwise
   - `req:ws_write(str)` sends `str` through the WebSocket-upgraded connection
   - `req:ws_read()` returns a string obtained from the WebSocket, or `nil` on error

Handler functions may return either `nil` (in which case, a `200 OK` response
is generated), or a number matching an HTTP status code.  Attempting to return
an invalid HTTP status code or anything other than a number or `nil` will result
in a `500 Internal Server Error` response being thrown.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `default_type` | `str` | `text/plain` | Default MIME-Type for responses |
| `script_file` | `str` | `NULL` | Path to Lua script|
| `cache_period` | `time` | `15s` | Time to keep Lua state loaded in memory |
| `script` | `str` | `NULL` | Inline lua script |

#### Rewrite

The `rewrite` module will match
[patterns](https://man.openbsd.org/patterns.7) in URLs and give the option
to either redirect to another URL, or rewrite the request in a way that Lwan
will handle the request as if it were made in that way originally.  The
patterns are a special kind of regular expressions, forked from Lua 5.3.1,
that do not contain backreferences and other features that could create
denial-of-service issues in Lwan.  The new URL can be specified using a
simple text substitution syntax, or use Lua scripts; Lua scripts will
contain the same metamethods available in the `req` metatable provided by
the Lua module, so it can be quite powerful.

Each instance of the rewrite module will require a `pattern` and the action
to execute when such pattern is matched.  Patterns are evaluated in the
order they appear in the configuration file, and are specified using nested
sections in the configuration file.  For instance, consider the following
example, where two patterns are specified:

```
rewrite /some/base/endpoint {
    pattern posts/(%d+) {
        # Matches /some/base/endpointposts/2600 and /some/base/endpoint/posts/2600
        rewrite_as = /cms/view-post?id=%1
    }
    pattern imgur/(%a+)/(%g+) {
        # Matches /some/base/endpointimgur/gif/mpT94Ld and /some/base/endpoint/imgur/gif/mpT94Ld
        redirect_to = https://i.imgur.com/%2.%1
    }
}
```

This example defines two patterns, one providing a nicer URL that's hidden
from the user, and another providing a different way to obtain a direct link
to an image hosted on a popular image hosting service (i.e.  requesting
`/some/base/endpoint/imgur/mp4/4kOZNYX` will redirect directly to a resource
in the Imgur service).

The value of `rewrite_as` or `redirect_to` can be Lua scripts as well; in
which case, the option `expand_with_lua` must be set to `true`, and, instead
of using the simple text substitution syntax as the example above, a
function named `handle_rewrite(req, captures)` has to be defined instead.
The `req` parameter is documented in the Lua module section; the `captures`
parameter is a table containing all the captures, in order.  This function
returns the new URL to redirect to.

This module has no options by itself.  Options are specified in each and
every pattern.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `rewrite_as` | `str` | `NULL` | Rewrite the URL following this pattern |
| `redirect_to` | `str` | `NULL` | Redirect to a new URL following this pattern |
| `expand_with_lua` | `bool` | `false` | Use Lua scripts to redirect to or rewrite a request |

`redirect_to` and `rewrite_as` options are mutually exclusive, and one of
them must be specified at least.

#### Redirect

The `redirect` module will, as it says in the tin, generate a `301
Moved permanently` (by default; the code can be changed, see below)
response, according to the options specified in its configuration.
Generally, the `rewrite` module should be used instead as it packs more
features; however, this module serves also as an example of how to
write Lwan modules (less than 100 lines of code).

If the `to` option is not specified, it always generates a `500
Internal Server Error` response.  Specifying an invalid HTTP code, or a
code that Lwan doesn't know about (see `enum lwan_http_status`), will
produce a `301 Moved Permanently` response.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `to` | `str` | `NULL` | The location to redirect to |
| `code` | `int` | `301` | The HTTP code to perform a redirect |

#### Response

The `response` module will generate an artificial response of any HTTP code.
In addition to also serving as an example of how to write a Lwan module,
it can be used to carve out voids from other modules (e.g. generating a
`405 Not Allowed` response for files in `/.git`, if `/` is served with
the `serve_files` module).

If the supplied `code` falls outside the response codes known by Lwan,
a `404 Not Found` error will be sent instead.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `code` | `int` | `999` | A HTTP response code |

### Authorization Section

Authorization sections can be declared in any module instance or handler,
and provides a way to authorize the fulfillment of that request through
the standard HTTP authorization mechanism.  In order to require authorization
to access a certain module instance or handler, declare an `authorization`
section with a `basic` parameter, and set one of its options.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `realm` | `str` | `Lwan` | Realm for authorization. This is usually shown in the user/password UI in browsers |
| `password_file` | `str` | `NULL` | Path for a file containing username and passwords (in clear text).  The file format is the same as the configuration file format used by Lwan |

Hacking
-------

Please read this section (and follow it) if you're planning on contributing
to Lwan.  There's nothing unexpected here; this mostly follows the rules and
expectations of many other FOSS projects, but every one expects things a
little bit different from one another.

### Coding Style

Lwan tries to follow a consistent coding style throughout the project.  If you're
considering contributing a patch to the project, please respect this style by trying
to match the style of the surrounding code.  In general:

 - `global_variables_are_named_like_this`, even though they tend to be rare and should be marked as `static` (with rare exceptions)
 - Local variables are usually shorter, e.g. `local_var`, `i`, `conn`
 - Struct names are often as short as they're descriptive.  `typedef` for structs are rarely used in Lwan
 - Header files should use `#pragma once` instead of the usual include guard hackery
 - Functions that are used between .c files but are not APIs to be exposed to liblwan should have their prototype added to `lwan-private.h`
 - Functions should be short and sweet.  Exceptions may apply
 - Public functions should be prefixed with `lwan_`
 - Public types should be prefixed with `lwan_`
 - Private functions must be static, and can be named without the `lwan_` prefix
 - Code is indented with 4 spaces; don't use tabs
 - There's a suggested line break at column 80, but it's not enforced
 - `/* Old C-style comments are preferred */`
 - `clang-format` can be used to format the source code in an acceptable way; a `.clang-format` file is provided

### Tests

If modifying well-tested areas of the code (e.g. the event loop, HTTP parser,
etc.), please add a new integration test and make sure that, before you send a
pull request, all tests (including the new ones you've sent) are working.
Tests can be added by modifying `src/scripts/testsuite.py`, and executed by
either invoking that script directly from the source root, or executing the
`testsuite` build target.

Some tests will only work on Linux, and won't be executed on other platforms.

### Fuzz-testing

Lwan is automatically fuzz-tested by
[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/).  To fuzz-test locally,
though, one can [follow the instructions to test
locally](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/docs/new_project_guide.md#testing-locally).

This fuzzes only the request parsing code.  There are plans to add fuzzing
drivers for other parts of the code, including the rewriting engine,
configuration file reader, template parser, and URL routing.

### Exporting APIs

The shared object version of `liblwan` on ELF targets (e.g. Linux) will use
a symbol filter script to hide symbols that are considered private to the
library.  Please edit `src/lib/liblwan.sym` to add new symbols that should
be exported to `liblwan.so`.

### Using Git and Pull Requests

Lwan tries to maintain a source history that's as flat as possible, devoid of
merge commits.  This means that pull requests should be rebased on top of the
current master before they can be merged; sometimes this can be done
automatically by the GitHub interface, sometimes they need some manual work to
fix conflicts.  It is appreciated if the contributor fixes these conflicts when
asked.

It is advisable to push your changes to your fork on a branch-per-pull request,
rather than pushing to the `master` branch; the reason is explained below.

Please ensure that Git is configured properly with your name (it doesn't really
matter if it is your legal name or a nickname, but it should be enough to credit
you) and a valid email address.  There's no need to add `Signed-off-by` lines,
even though it's fine to send commits with them.

If a change is requested in a pull request, you have two choices:

 - *Reply asking for clarification.*  Maybe the intentions were not clear enough,
and whoever asked for changes didn't fully understand what you were trying to
achieve
 - *Fix the issue.*  When fixing issues found in pull requests, *please* use
[interactive rebases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) to
squash or fixup commits; don't add your fixes on top of your tree.  Do not create
another pull request just to accomodate the changes. After rewriting
the history locally, force-push to your PR branch; the PR will update automatically
with your changes.  Rewriting the history of development branches is fine, and
force-pushing them is normal and expected

It is not enforced, but it is recommended to create smaller commits. How
commits are split in Lwan is pretty much arbitrary, so please take a look at
the commit history to get an idea on how the division should be made.  Git
offers a plethora of commands to achieve this result: the already mentioned
interactive rebase, the `-p` option to `git add`, and `git commit --amend`
are good examples.

Commit messages should have one line of summary (~72 chars), followed by an
empty line, followed by paragraphs of 80-char lines explaining the change.  The
paragraphs explaining the changes are usually not necessary if the summary
is good enough.  Try to [write good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### Licensing

Lwan is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2, or (at your option),
any later version.  Therefore:

 - Code must be either LGPLv2.1, GPLv2, a permissive "copyfree" license that is compatible
with GPLv2 (e.g. MIT, BSD 3-clause), or public domain code (e.g. CC0)
 - Although the program can be distributed and used as if it were licensed as GPLv3,
its code must be compatible with GPLv2 as well; no new code can be licensed under versions
of GPL newer than 2
 - Likewise, code licensed under licenses compatible with GPLv3 but
incompatible with GPLv2 (e.g.  Apache 2) are not suitable for inclusion in
Lwan
 - Even if the license does not specify that credit should be given (e.g. CC0-licensed code),
please give credit to the original author for that piece of code
 - Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to use a GPL'd piece of code on a server without
having to share the code for your application.  It is only when the binary of that server is
shared that source must be available to whoever has that binary.  Merely accessing a Lwan
server through HTTP does not qualify as having access to the binary program that's running
on the server
 - When in doubt, don't take legal advice from a README file: please consult
a lawyer that understands free software licensing

Portability
-----------

While Lwan was written originally for Linux, it has been ported to BSD
systems as well.  The build system will detect the supported features
and build support library functions as appropriate.

For instance, [epoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll) has been
implemented on top of [kqueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue), and
Linux-only syscalls and GNU extensions have been implemented for the
supported systems.  [This blog post](https://tia.mat.br/posts/2018/06/28/include_next_and_portability.html)
explains the details and how `#include_next` is used.

Performance
-----------

It can achieve good performance, yielding about **320000 requests/second**
on a Core i7 laptop for requests without disk access, and without pipelining.

When disk I/O is required, for files up to 16KiB, it yields about
**290000 requests/second**; for larger files, this drops to **185000
requests/second**, which isn't too shabby either.

These results, of course, with keep-alive connections, and with weighttp
running on the same machine (and thus using resources that could be used
for the webserver itself).

Without keep-alive, these numbers drop around 6-fold.

IRC Channel
-----------

There is an IRC channel (`#lwan`) on [Freenode](http://freenode.net). A
standard IRC client can be used.  A [web IRC gateway](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23lwan&uio=d4)
is also available.
